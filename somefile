Git workflow

based on http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html

Anything in the master branch is deployable
To work on something new, create a descriptively named branch off of master (ie: new-oauth2-scopes)
Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on github
When the branch is ready to be deployed, create a pull request in GitHub
After someone else has reviewed the changes, you can complete the pull request and merge into master

create a local branch from master
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout -b descriptive-branch-name master

[make changes]

push branch to github
git add …….
git commit -m “my cool descriptive commit message”
git pull --rebase
git push -u origin descriptive-branch-name

start a pull request from github: https://github.com/briankonrath/mt_yii/compare/
base: master
compare: descriptive-branch-name

Now someone else can review the changes and comment whether it is ready or not.
When it is ready, you can merge into master using github.

Now delete your branch:
git checkout master
git pull
git branch -d descriptive-branch-name
